          <h3>Do not dream for web developer</h3>
          <p>"Don't just dream about the web—build it. While others are sleeping, we are staying up late, fueled by caffeine and dark mode, turning logic into art. In this space, we don't follow dreams; we write the scripts that make them a reality."</p>

        <h2>ABOUT ADNAN</h2>
        <h3 class="name-highlight">SCIENCE STUDENT</h3>
        <p>"In this corner of the code, Adnan is treating the entire DOM tree like a high-stakes chemistry experiment where one missing semicolon could lead to a total system meltdown. He doesn't just 'write' code; he hypothesizes that the background color should be #333, runs three controlled trials, and then documents the results in a lab report that nobody asked for. To Adnan, a website is basically a digital organism, and he’s currently trying to figure out if he can use gravity equations to make the scrolling smoother. He firmly believes that if he can just find the right formula, he can make his CSS perfectly symmetrical, but for now, he’s stuck in a perpetual loop of 'Trial and Error'—mostly error—while trying to explain to Turag that code is actually just a very complex arrangement of subatomic logic gates."</p>

        <h2>ABOUT TURAG</h2>
        <h3 class="name-highlight">COMMERCE STUDENT</h3>
        <p>"Over in Turag’s section, the website is being managed like a Fortune 500 company. Every div tag has to justify its existence with a high conversion rate, and if a button isn't generating clicks, Turag considers it a 'bad investment' and threatens to liquidate the entire header. He’s currently trying to figure out how to 'outsource' the debugging process to a cheaper browser and is convinced that 'Dark Mode' is just a clever way to save on the electricity bill. While Adnan is worried about the 'physics' of the layout, Turag is busy auditing the pixel budget to ensure there is no 'inflation' in the padding. He treats every syntax error like a tax audit, and his ultimate goal is to find a way to make the 'Back to Top' button generate compound interest every time a user scrolls."</p>
